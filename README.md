## Product Inspiration: 
www.itsjacquiek.com www.nynyhairsalon.com

## Tools: 
AdobeXD
I chose AdobeXD over Adobe Photoshop because of its feature-duplicating functionality whch made creating **_"Portfolio_** and 
**_"Book Appointment"_** pages so much faster in addition to other great functionalities.
 

## A Little Backstory:
Hairli is a beautiful, easy-to-use website that allows clients to book appointments with a hair stylist online. 

The first step of the design process was researching existing salon websites to get a basic idea for the main features needed for a 
hair business website. 

I then created the wireframes and revised them as needed. The wireframes were used as the foundation for the high fidelity prototype. 
Due to the limited time, all further adjustments to the UI were made on the high fidelity prototype. The UI prototype was then 
reviewed by seven target users and finalized.

The primary colours were specifically tailored to the female target audience, with studies showing that their use increases
user engagement and sales. The design was kept clean and minimal for ease of navigation. 

* The **_"Book An Appointment"_** button provided on the Home page, gives the user a direct shortcut to the **_"Book Appointment"_** page to save time
* The **_"Services"_** page provides clients with pictures showing the general appearance of each hairstyle category
* The **_"Portfolio_** page shows pictures of past work
* The **_"Book Appointment"_** page allows the user to book a hair appointment on their preferred date and time. It
also shows pricing for different style modifications according to the clientâ€™s needs
